My motivation was to be prepared for the bootcamp as possible.

The problem this project solved was giving me a place to store all my notes regarding what I learned. 
I learned a basic introduction to HTML CSS Git & JavaScript.

## Installation

## Usage

T review the notes I've made and add more notes as I continue to complete the bootcamp.  These notes will be essential to my success.  So far we have notes on GTML CSS Git & JavaScript while also using functions and math. 
For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
